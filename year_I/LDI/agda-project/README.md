# agda-project

Instructions:

* Please write the solutions to the problems in `submission.lagda.md`.
* Please complete `name.txt` with your personal information.

It is possible to import `submission.lagda.md` into [nextjournal](https://nextjournal.com/) and solve the problems there.
At the end, export the markdown file from nextjournal with "... -> export" and use its contents to replace `submission.lagda.md`.

(Alternatively, you can work on `submission.lagda.md` from emacs, or Atom, or VS Code.)

Deadline: May 18, 2020, 20:00 CEST.

**Note:** Do not play with the markers `-- BEGIN PROBLEM` and `-- END PROBLEM` in `submission.lagda.md`,
as this may break the grading mechanism.
