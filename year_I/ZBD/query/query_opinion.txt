My task was greatly simplified, because I have also run analyze on
my own postgres and it showed me how important is a good query plan.

For instance, my postgres uses index-only-scan, which is not in the
version on mimuw.

postgres_10_7_analyze.sql looks like optimum for me. It expects
not that many teammember rows (100) (much less than version 9.0.1) which
is closer to truth (9).
And then it just goes to fetch those 9 battles exactly after obtaining
indexes of teammember.

Older version (faculty one) expects a lot of teammember (~30000) rows and then does
some crazy seq scan of battle table and execution takes more than
10^5 longer, which is insane. Although it might make sense if there
truly were 30000 rows (but there cannot be - it would take playing without
stop all the time for 50 days, which is query range).

To sum up, my query suggest using modern postgres on a good machine.
Also, we can create an index for battle.time (range), because
we might often do ranges on time.
STATISTICS target also seems like a interesting parmeter,
since accurate predicitons make a huge difference.
